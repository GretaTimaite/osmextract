## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I have made the following changes:

* Documented the objects returned by oe_find() and oe_search(). 
* Reset the user's values for par and options when they are changed in the vignettes

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
