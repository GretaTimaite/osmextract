This vignette provides an introduction to using the package, building on the README which covers installation and our motivations for creating it.

Loading the package generates important messages about the license associated with OSM data.

```{r setup}
library(osmextract)
```

The first thing to say is: **do not ignore this message**!
The Open Street Map (OSM) extracts linked with this packages are stored by external providers such as [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/), [Bbbike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/), or [OpenStreetMap.fr](http://download.openstreetmap.fr/). 
There are important legal considerations that you should be aware of before using OSM data, especially if you are working in a for-profit capacity.

# Legal considerations

Anyone using OSM data is bound by law to adhere to the [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/), which means that you must:

- **Attribute**: You must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the ODbL. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database.
- **Share-Alike**: If you publicly use any adapted version of this database, or works produced from an adapted database, you must also offer that adapted database under the ODbL.
- **Keep open**: If you redistribute the database or an adapted version of it, then you may use technological measures that restrict the work (such as DRM) as long as you also redistribute a version without such measures.

In short, publicly using OSM data without attribution or selling datasets derived from it is illegal.
See the [License/Use Cases page on the OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/License/Use_Cases) for detailed use cases.

# Main package functions

The package is composed of the following main functions: 

1. `oe_providers()`: Show which OSM extracts' providers are available;
1. `oe_match()`: Match an input place with one of the files stored by the OSM providers;
1. `oe_download()`: Download the chosen file;
1. `oe_vectortranslate()`: Convert between `.pbf` and `.gpkg` formats;
1. `oe_read()`: Read `.pbf` and `.gpkg` files;
1. `oe_get()`: Match, download, translate, and import data, all in one step.

For many users who just want to get OSM data quickly `oe_get()` may be sufficient, as covered in the README.
We will demonstrate each function in turn. 
As you can see, the name of the most important functions in this package start with `oe_*`.
<!-- Mention auto-completion stuff -->

## `oe_providers()`: List providers

`oe_providers()` lists the providers that are currently available with the version of `osmextract` you have installed.

```{r}
oe_providers()
```

Each element in the column `database_name` is a data object that is packaged with `osmextract`. 
You can read a detailed description of each provider data running, for example, `?geofabrik_zones` or `?bbbike_zones`. 

Perhaps the best known bulk OSM data provider is probably Geofabrik, represented as a `data.frame` in the packaged object `geofabrik_zones`.

```{r}
class(geofabrik_zones)
```

Note that in addition to being a data frame with rows and columns, `geofabrik_zones` is also an `sf` object, as defined in the [package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) of the same name.
When working with `sf` objects, it makes sense to have the package loaded:

```{r}
library(sf)
```

That gives you access to many functions for working with geographic vector data of the type provided by `osmextract`.
Each row of data in an `sf` object contains a geometry, representing the area covered by a provider zone, meaning you can plot the data as follows:

```{r}
par(mar = rep(0.1, 4))
plot(st_geometry(geofabrik_zones))
```

The plot above shows how the provider divides geographic space into discrete chunks.
Different providers have other zoning systems. 
For example: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
par(mar = rep(0.1, 4))
plot(st_geometry(spData::world), xlim = c(-2, 10), ylim = c(35, 60))
plot(st_geometry(bbbike_zones), xlim = c(-2, 10), ylim = c(35, 60), col = "darkred", add = TRUE)
```

As shown in the above visualisation of [BBBike.org](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/) zones in Europe, the provider offers rectangular extracts of major cities.
We are working on adding support for manually selected regions from the BBBike website (see https://github.com/ITSLeeds/osmextract/issues/100).

Check the ["Comparing the supported OSM providers"](https://itsleeds.github.io/osmextract/articles/providers_comparisons.html) vignette for some simple guidance on how to choose the best provider. 

## `oe_match()`: Match OSM extracts

`oe_match()` takes in input a string (through the parameter `place`), and it returns a named list of length two with the URL and the size (in bytes) of a `.osm.pbf` file representing a geographical zone stored by one of the supported providers. 
For example: 

```{r}
oe_match("Italy", quiet = TRUE)
oe_match("Leeds", provider = "bbbike", quiet = TRUE)
```

The operations for matching a string with a geographical zone are based on the minimum Approximate String Distance (`?adist()`) between the input `place` and one of the fields in the provider's database. 
By default, the function uses the field `name` and Geofabrik provider. 

You can select alternative fields in the provider's data (instead of the default field, i.e. `name`) using the `match_by` parameter. 
For example, if you work with `geofabrik_data`, then you can look for a match using [iso3166-1 alpha2](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes: 

```{r}
oe_match("RU", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
oe_match("US", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
```

There are a few cases where the `iso3166-1 alpha2` codes in `geofabrik_data` cannot be used since there are no per-country extracts (e.g. Israel and Palestine):

```{r, error = TRUE}
oe_match("PS", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
oe_match("IL", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2")
```

For this reason, we coded a function that let you explore the matching operations according to a pre-defined pattern. 
For example:

```{r}
oe_match_pattern("London", provider = "geofabrik")
oe_match_pattern("Russia")
oe_match_pattern("Palestine")
```

The default field is `name`, but we can change that as follows: 

```{r}
oe_match_pattern("US", match_by = "iso3166_2")
```

The default provider is `Geofabrik`, but we can also change that: 

```{r}
oe_match_pattern("Washington", provider = "bbbike")
```

If we set `full_row = TRUE`, then `oe_match_pattern()` will return the complete row(s) from the provider's data: 

```{r}
oe_match_pattern("Israel", full_row = TRUE)[, 1:3]
```

You can combine the two approaches to select a geographical area: 

```{r}
oe_match_pattern("London")
oe_match("Greater London")
```

<!-- `oe_match()` function returns an error if the minimum approximate string distance between the input `place` and the closest match is greater than the parameter `max_string_dist` (which defaults to 1).  -->
The parameter `max_string_dist` (which defaults to 1) is used to test if the input place and the closest match in the provider's data are not similar enough. 
You can always increase the value (and "help" the matching operations), but you should also check for erroneous matches. 
For example: 

```{r, error = TRUE}
oe_match("London", max_string_dist = 3) # erroneous match
```

The parameter `max_string_dist` is always set to 0 if `match_by` argument is equal to `iso3166_1_alpha2` or `iso3166_2` to avoid matching with the wrong iso3166 code. 

If the approximate string distance between the closest match and the input `place` is greater than `max_string_dist`, then `oe_match()` will also check the other supported providers. 
For example: 

```{r}
oe_match("leeds", provider = "geofabrik")
```

If it doesn't an exact match with any supported provider and `match_by` parameter is equal to `name`, then the function will use the [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/) to geolocate the input `place` and perform a spatial matching operation (see below). 
For example: 

```{r}
oe_match("Milan")
```

`oe_match()` function returns a warning message if there are multiple zones equidistant (according to approximate string distance) from the input `place`. 
In that case, it selects the first match: 

```{r, warning = TRUE}
oe_match("Belin")
```

### Finding zones based on geographic inputs

The input `place` can also be specified using an `sfc_POINT` object with arbitrary CRS, as documented in the following example. 
The function will return a named list of length two with the URL and the size of a `.osm.pbf` file representing a zone that geographically intersects the `sfc_POINT` (or an error, if the input point does not cross any area). 
If the input `place` intersects multiple geographically nested zones, the function returns the area with the highest `level` ^[Check the help page of the chosen provider to understand the meaning of the field `level`. Approximately, we could say that the higher is the level, the smaller is the geographical area.]. 
If there are multiple matches with the same `level`, then `oe_match()` function will return the area whose centroid is closest to the input `place`. 

```{r}
milan_duomo = sf::st_sfc(sf::st_point(c(1514924, 5034552)), crs = 3003)
oe_match(milan_duomo)
```

Finally, you can specify the input `place` using a numeric vector of coordinates. 
In that case, the CRS is assumed to be [EPSG:4326](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/):

```{r}
oe_match(c(9.1916, 45.4650)) # Duomo di Milano using EPSG: 4326
```

To reduce unnecessary computational resources and save bandwidth/electricity, we will use a small OSM extract in subsequent sections that can be found as follows:

```{r}
# ITS stands for Institute for Transport Studies: https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport
(its_details = oe_match("ITS Leeds", provider = "test"))
```

## `oe_download()`: Download OSM extracts 

The purpose of `oe_download()` is to download `.osm.pbf` files representing OSM extracts.
This function takes in input a URL, and it downloads the requested file in a directory (specified by the parameter `download_directory`):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
oe_download(
  file_url = its_details$url, 
  file_size = its_details$file_size,
  provider = "test",
  download_directory = "."
)
```

The argument `provider` can be omitted if the input `file_url` is associated with one of the supported providers.
The standard value for `download_directory` is `tempdir()`, but, if you want to set a directory that will persist, you can add `OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/path/for/osm/data` in your `.Renviron` file, e.g. with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
# Add a line containing: OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY=/path/to/save/files
```

You can always check the default `download_directory` used by `oe_download()` with: 

```{r}
oe_download_directory()
```

We strongly advise you set a persistent directory since downloading and converting (see the next sub-section) `.pbf` file are expensive operations, that are skipped by all `oe_*()` functions if they detect that the input `.pbf` file was already downloaded and/or converted.

More precisely, `oe_download()` runs several checks before actually downloading a new file, to avoid overloading the OSM providers. 
The first step is the definition of the path associated with the input `file_url`. 
The path is created by pasting together the `download_directory`, the name of the chosen provider (specified by `provider` argument or inferred from the input URL), and the `basename()` of the URL. 
For example, if `file_url` is equal to `"https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/italy-latest.osm.pbf"`, and `download_directory = "/tmp/`, then the path is built as `/tmp/geofabrik_italy-latest.osm.pbf`. 
Then, the function checks if the new path already exists (using `file.exists()`) and, in that case, it returns it (without downloading anything^[The parameter `force_download` is used to override this behaviour.]). 
Otherwise, it downloads a new file (using `download.file()` and setting the argument `destfile` equal to the new path and `mode = "wb"`), and then it returns the path.

## `oe_vectortranslate()`: Convert to gpkg format

`oe_vectortranslate()` function translates a `.pbf` file into `.gpkg` format. 
It takes in input a string representing the path to an existing `.pbf` file, and it returns the path to the newly generated `.gpkg` file. 
The `.gpkg` file is created in the same directory as the input `.pbf` file and with the same name. 
The conversion is performed using [ogr2ogr](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html#ogr2ogr) through `vectortranslate` utility in `sf::gdal_utils()`.

We decided to adopt this approach and create this function following [the suggestions](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/2100#issuecomment-565707053) of the maintainers of GDAL.
Let's start with an example.
First, we download the `.pbf` file associated with ITS example: 

```{r}
its_pbf = oe_download(its_details$url, provider = "test")
list.files(oe_download_directory(), pattern = "pbf|gpkg")
```

and then we convert it to `.gpkg` format: 

```{r}
its_gpkg = oe_vectortranslate(its_pbf)
list.files(oe_download_directory(), pattern = "pbf|gpkg")
```

The vectortranslate operation can be customised in several ways modifying the parameters `layer`, `extra_tags`, `osmconf_ini`, and `vectortranslate_options`.

### `layer`

The `.pbf` files processed by GDAL are usually categorized into 5 layers, named `points`, `lines`, `multilinestrings`, `multipolygons` and `other_relations` ^[Check the first paragraphs [here](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html) for more details.]. 
The `oe_vectortranslate()` function can covert only one layer at a time. 
Nevertheless, several layers with different names can be stored in the same `.gpkg` file. 
By default, the function will convert the `lines` layer (which is the most common one according to our experience), but you can change it using the parameter `layer`. 

The `.pbf` files always contain all five layers: 

```{r}
st_layers(its_pbf, do_count = TRUE)
```

while, by default, `oe_vectortranslate` convert only the `lines` layer: 

```{r}
st_layers(its_gpkg, do_count = TRUE)
```

We can add another layer as follows: 

```{r}
its_gpkg = oe_vectortranslate(its_pbf, layer = "points")
st_layers(its_gpkg, do_count = TRUE)
```

### `osmconf_ini` and `extra_tags`

The arguments `osmconf_ini` and `extra_tags` are used to modify how GDAL reads and processes a `.pbf` file. 
More precisely, several operations that GDAL performs on a `.pbf` file are governed by a `CONFIG` file, that you can check at the following [link](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/data/osmconf.ini). 
For example, the basic components of OSM data are called [*elements*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements) and they are divided into *nodes*, *ways* or *relations*. 
The code at line 7 of that CONFIG file is used to determine which *ways* are assumed to be *polygons* if they are closed.

The parameter `osmconf_ini` can be used to specify the path to an existing ad-hoc `CONFIG` file, in case you need full control over GDAL operations. 
See the next sub-sections for an example. 
If `osmconf_ini` is equal to `NULL` (the default), then `oe_vectortranslate()` function uses the standard `CONFIG` file.

OSM data is usually described using several [*tags*](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags), i.e. pairs of two items: a *key* and a *value*.
The code at lines 33, 53, 85, 103, and 121 of default `CONFIG` file determines, for each layer, which tags are explicitly reported as fields (while all the other tags are stored in the `other_tags` column, see [here](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html#other-tags-field) for more details). 
The parameter `extra_tags` (default value: `NULL`) governs which tags are explicitly reported in the `.gpkg` file and are omitted from the `other_tags` field. 
The default tags are always included (unless you modify the `CONFIG` file). 
Please note that the argument `extra_tags` is ignored if `osmconf_ini` is not `NULL` (since we do not know how you generated the new `.ini` file). 

Lastly, the `oe_get_keys()` function can be used to check all `keys` that are stored in the `other_tags` field for a given `.gpkg` file. 
For example, 

```{r}
oe_get_keys(its_gpkg, layer = "lines")
```

We can always re-create the `.gpkg` file adding new `tags` (i.e. key/value pairs): 

```{r}
its_gpkg = oe_vectortranslate(its_pbf, extra_tags = c("bicycle", "foot"))
```

See the `oe_get()` section for more complex use-cases. 

### `vectortranslate_options`

The parameter `vectortranslate_options` is used to control the arguments that are passed to `ogr2ogr` via `sf::gdal_utils()` when converting between `.pbf` and `.gpkg` formats. 
`ogr2ogr` can perform various operations during the translation process, such as spatial filters or SQL queries, and these operations are determined by the `vectortranslate_options` argument. 
If `NULL` (default value), then `vectortranslate_options` is set equal to `c("-f", "GPKG", "-overwrite", "-oo", paste0("CONFIG_FILE=", osmconf_ini),  "-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry", layer)`. 
Explanation:

* `"-f", "GPKG"` says that the output format is `GPKG`. This is mandatory for GDAL < 2.3;
* `"-overwrite` is used to delete an existing layer and recreate it empty;
* `"-oo", paste0("CONFIG_FILE=", osmconf_ini)` is used to modify the [open options](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/osm.html#open-options) for the `.osm.pbf` file and set the `CONFIG` file;
* `"-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry"` adjust the [layer creation options](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/gpkg.html?highlight=gpkg#layer-creation-options) for the `.gpkg` file, modifying the name of the geometry column; 
* `layer` indicates which layer should be converted.

The arguments that are passed to `vectortranslate_options` can also be used to perform queries during the vectortranslate process. 
Check the following sections to see more examples with different vectortranslate options. 

### Other notes

By default, vectortranslate operations are skipped if `oe_vectortranslate()` function detects a file having the same path as the input file, `.gpkg` extension and a layer with the same name as the parameter `layer` with all `extra_tags`. 
In that case, the function will return the path of the `.gpkg` file. 
This behaviour can be overwritten by setting `force_vectortranslate = TRUE`. 
If `osmconf_ini` or `vectortranslate_options` parameters are not `NULL`, the vectortranslate operations are never skipped.

Starting from `sf` version [0.9.6](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/news/index.html#version-0-9-6-2020-09-13), if `quiet` argument is equal to `FALSE`, then `oe_vectortranslate()` will display a progress bar.

## `oe_read()`: Read-in OSM data 

The `oe_read()` function is wrapper around `oe_download()`, `oe_vectortranslate()`, and `sf::st_read()`. 
It is used for reading-in a `.pbf` or `.gpkg` file that is specified using its path or a URL. 

So, for example, the following code can be used for reading-in the `its-gpkg` file: 

```{r}
oe_read(its_gpkg)
```

If the input `file_path` points to a `.osm.pbf` file, the vectortranslate operations can be skipped using the parameter `skip_vectortranslate`. 
In that case, `oe_read()` will ignore the conversion step. 

```{r}
oe_read(its_pbf, skip_vectortranslate = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)
```

We can see that the output data includes nine fields (i.e. the default tags), while the previous example had 11 fields (i.e. the default tags + `bicycle` and `foot` tags, that were added to the `.gpkg` file a few chunks above). 

We can also read an object starting from a URL: 

```{r}
my_url = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/osmextract/raw/master/inst/its-example.osm.pbf"
oe_read(my_url, provider = "test", quiet = FALSE, force_download = TRUE, force_vectortranslate = TRUE)
```

Please note that if you are reading from a URL which is not linked with any of the supported providers, you need to specify the `provider` parameter. 
The `test_its-example.osm.pbf` file already exists in the `download_directory`, but we forced the download and vectortranslate operations. 

## `oe_get()`: Do it all in one step 

To simplify the steps outlined above, while enabling modularity if needs be, we packaged them all into a single function that works as follows:

```{r}
its_lines = oe_get("ITS Leeds")
par(mar = rep(0.1, 4))
plot(its_lines["osm_id"], lwd = 2)
```

The function `oe_get()` is a wrapper around `oe_match()` and `oe_read()`, and it summarizes the algorithm that we use for importing OSM extracts: 

1. Match the input `place` with the URL of a `.pbf` file through `oe_match()`;
2. Download the corresponding `.pbf` file using `oe_download()`; 
3. Convert it into `.gpkg` format using `oe_vectortranslate()`; 
4. Read-in the `.gpkg` file using `sf::st_read()`. 

The following commands (not evaluated here) show how `oe_get()` can be used to import the OSM extracts associated with the desired input `place`, after downloading the `.pbf` file and performing the vectortranslate operations. 
We suggest you run the commands and check the output. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
oe_get("Andorra", quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("Leeds", provider = "bbbike", quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("Goa", provider = "openstreetmap_fr", quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("Malta", layer = "points", quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("RU", match_by = "iso3166_1_alpha2", quiet = FALSE)

oe_get("Andorra", download_only = TRUE) # See also ?oe_find
oe_get_keys(oe_get("Andorra", download_only = TRUE))
oe_get("Andorra", extra_tags = c("maxspeed", "oneway", "ref", "junction"), quiet = FALSE)
oe_get("Andora", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, quiet = TRUE, as_tibble = TRUE) # like read_sf

# Geocode the capital of Goa, India
(geocode_panaji = tmaptools::geocode_OSM("Panaji, India"))
oe_get(geocode_panaji$coords, provider = "openstreetmap_fr", quiet = FALSE)

# Spatial match starting from the coordinates of Arequipa, Peru
geocode_arequipa <- c(-71.537005, -16.398874)
oe_get(geocode_arequipa, quiet = FALSE)
oe_get(geocode_arequipa, provider = "bbbike", quiet = FALSE) # Error
oe_get(geocode_arequipa, provider = "openstreetmap_fr", quiet = FALSE) # No county extract
```

The arguments `osmconf_ini`, `vectortranslate_options` and `query` (defined in `sf::st_read`) can be used to further optimize the process of getting OSM extracts into R.  

### `osmconf_ini`

The following example shows how to create an ad-hoc `osmconf.ini` file, which is used by GDAL to read a `.pbf` file in a customised way. 
First of all, we load a local copy of the default `osmconf.ini` file, taken from the following [link](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/data/osmconf.ini). 

```{r}
custom_osmconf_ini = readLines(system.file("osmconf.ini", package = "osmextract"))
```

Then, we modify the code at lines 18 and 21, setting the parameters for reporting all nodes and all ways (even without any significant tag),

```{r}
custom_osmconf_ini[[18]] = "report_all_nodes=yes"
custom_osmconf_ini[[21]] = "report_all_ways=yes"
```

and the code at lines 45 and 53, removing the `osm_id` field and changing the default attributes: 

```{r}
custom_osmconf_ini[[45]] = "osm_id=no"
custom_osmconf_ini[[53]] = "attributes=highway,lanes"
```

Another significant parameter that can be customised during the creating of an ad-hoc `osmconf.ini` file is `closed_ways_area_polygons` (see lines 5-7 of the default CONFIG file). 
We can now write the `custom_osmconf_ini` file: 

```{r}
temp_ini = tempfile(fileext = ".ini")
writeLines(custom_osmconf_ini, temp_ini)
```

and read the ITS Leeds file with the new `osmconf.ini` file: 

```{r}
oe_get("ITS Leeds", provider = "test", osmconf_ini = temp_ini, quiet = FALSE)
```

If we compare it with the default output: 

```{r}
oe_get("ITS Leeds", provider = "test", quiet = FALSE, force_vectortranslate = TRUE)
```

we can see that there are 2 extra features in the `sf` object that was read-in using the customized `CONFIG` file (i.e. 191 features instead of 189 since we set `"report_all_nodes=yes"` and `"report_all_ways=yes"`) and just 4 field: `highway`, `lanes` (see the code a few chunks above), `z_order` (check the code [here](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/9f31018839b32aeeafad7663a8de662153a956c3/gdal/data/osmconf.ini#L65-L71)), and `other_tags`.

Please note that the argument `extra_tags` is always ignored (with a warning message), if you are using an ad-hoc `osmconf.ini` file: 

```{r}
oe_get("ITS Leeds", provider = "test", osmconf_ini = temp_ini, quiet = FALSE, extra_tags = "foot")
```

### `vectortranslate_options`

The parameter `vectortranslate_options` is used to modify the options that are passed to [ogr2ogr](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html#ogr2ogr). 
This is extremely important because if we tune the `vectortranslate_options` parameter, then we can analyse small parts of an enormous `.pbf` files without fully reading it in memory. 

The first example, reported in the following chunk, shows how to use the argument `-t_srs` to modify the CRS of the output `.gpkg` object (from [`EPSG:4326`](https://epsg.io/4326) to [`EPSG:27700`](https://epsg.io/27700)) while performing vectortranslate operations: 

```{r}
my_vectortranslate = c(
  "-f", "GPKG", #output file format
  "-overwrite", # overwrite an existing layer
  "-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry", # layer creation options, 
  "-t_srs", "EPSG:27700", # British National Grid CRS
  "lines" #layer
)
# Check the CRS
oe_get("ITS Leeds", vectortranslate_options = my_vectortranslate, quiet = FALSE)
```

The next example illustrates how to apply an SQL-like query during the vectortranslate process. 
More precisely, we can use the arguments `-select` and `-where` to create an SQL-like query, that is run during the vectortranslate process. 
Check [here](https://gdal.org/user/ogr_sql_dialect.html) for more details on the OGR SQL dialect. 

First of all, we need to build a character vector with the options that will be passed to `ogr2ogr: `

```{r}
my_vectortranslate = c(
  "-f", "GPKG", #output file format
  "-overwrite", # overwrite an existing file
  "-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry", # layer creation options,
  "-t_srs", "EPSG:27700", # British National Grid CRS
  # SQL-like query where we select only two fields
  "-select", "osm_id, highway", 
  # SQL-like query where we select only the features where highway is in (footway, cycleway)
  "-where", "highway IN ('footway', 'cycleway')",
  "lines" #layer
)
```

and then we can process the file: : 

```{r}
its_leeds = oe_get("ITS Leeds", vectortranslate_options = my_vectortranslate, quiet = FALSE)
```

The same procedure can be repeated using an ad-hoc `osmconf.ini` file.

These arguments are fundamental if you need to work with a small portion of a bigger `.pbf` file. 
For example, the following code (not run in the vignette) is used to extract all `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary` roads from the `.pbf` file of Portugal stored by Geofabrik servers.
It takes approximately 100 seconds to run it using an HP ENVY Notebook with Intel i7-7500U processor and 8GB of RAM using Windows 10:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_vectortranslate = c(
  "-f", "GPKG", #output file format
  "-overwrite", # overwrite an existing file
  "-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry", # layer creation options,
  # SQL-like query where we select only the features where highway in (primary, secondary, tertiary)
  "-select", "osm_id, highway",
  "-where", "highway IN ('primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary')",
  "lines" #layer
)
system.time({
  portugal1 = oe_get("Portugal", vectortranslate_options = my_vectortranslate)
})
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   26.91   12.64   38.78 
```

while the classical approach (not run in the vignette) is slower and it provides identical results: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  portugal2 = oe_get("Portugal", quiet = FALSE, force_vectortranslate = TRUE)
  portugal2 = portugal2 %>% 
    dplyr::select(osm_id, highway) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(highway %in% c('primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary'))
})
#>   user  system elapsed 
#> 156.21   75.84  255.82
nrow(portugal1) == nrow(portugal2)
#> TRUE
```

The following example shows how to use the argument `-clipsrc` to clip the input intdata using a bounding box or a polygon (defined as WKT, see `sf::st_as_text()`). 
First we need to define a polygon centered in the area around ITS Leeds and create its WKT representation: 

```{r}
# Define a really small POLYGON in the area of ITS Leeds
its_small_poly = st_sfc(
  st_polygon(
    list(
      rbind(
        c(-1.559184, 53.807739), 
        c(-1.557895, 53.807571), 
        c(-1.557375, 53.808094), 
        c(-1.558524, 53.808192),
        c(-1.559184, 53.807739)
      )
    )
  )
)
its_small_wkt = st_as_text(its_small_poly)
```

Then we set the `vectortranslate_options`:

```{r}
my_vectortranslate = c(
  "-f", "GPKG", #output file format
  "-overwrite", # overwrite an existing file
  "-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry", # layer creation options
  "-clipsrc", its_small_wkt,
  "lines" #layer
)
```

and run `oe_get()`:

```{r}
its_small_sf = oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds", 
  vectortranslate_options = my_vectortranslate, 
  quiet = FALSE
)
plot(its_small_sf["osm_id"])
```

The plot above represents a small portion of the ITS Leeds area: 

```{r}
plot(its_lines["osm_id"], lwd = 2, reset = FALSE)
plot(its_small_poly, add = TRUE, lwd = 2)
```

This approach is faster than translating, reading and applying a spatial filter to a full `.pbf` file, especially for larger areas. 
For example (not run in the vignette): 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Define a 15Km circular buffer around Rome
rome_buffer = st_sfc(st_buffer(st_point(c(291187, 4640996)), 15000), crs = 32633) %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

# vectortranslate approach
system.time({
  rome_buffer_wkt = st_as_text(rome_buffer)
  my_osmconf_ini = system.file("osmconf.ini", package = "osmextract")
  my_vectortranslate = c(
  "-f", "GPKG", #output file format
  "-overwrite", # overwrite an existing file
  "-lco", "GEOMETRY_NAME=geometry", # layer creation options
  "-clipsrc", rome_buffer_wkt,
  "lines" #layer
  )
  rome1 = oe_get(
    st_sfc(st_point(c(291187, 4640996)), crs = 32633), 
    force_download = TRUE, 
    quiet = FALSE, 
    vectortranslate_options = my_vectortranslate
  )
})
#>    user   system  elapsed 
#>   71.36    69.95   162.36

# Classical approach
system.time({
  center_italy = oe_get(
    st_sfc(st_point(c(291187, 4640996)), crs = 32633), 
    quiet = FALSE, 
    force_download = TRUE, 
    force_vectortranslate = TRUE
  )
  rome2 = center_italy[rome_buffer, ]
})
#>    user  system  elapsed 
#>  119.59   56.94   251.75
```

Please notice the following warning message that may be returned by `ogr2ogr` with argument `-clipsrc`: 

> Warning message:
In CPL_gdalvectortranslate(source, destination, options, oo, doo) :
  GDAL Message 1: A geometry of type MULTILINESTRING is inserted into layer lines of geometry type LINESTRING, which is not normally allowed by the GeoPackage specification, but the driver will however do it. To create a conformant GeoPackage, if using ogr2ogr, the -nlt option can be used to override the layer geometry type. This warning will no longer be emitted for this combination of layer and feature geometry type.

### `query`

The main drawback of the vectortranslate approach is that you need to rerun the `ogr2ogr` utility every time you change your query. 
If you are dealing with medium-size `.osm.pbf` data, the easier (and perhaps faster) solution may be converting all the fields and all the features from `.pbf` to `.gpkg` format, and then use the `query` parameter from `sf::st_read()`. 

For example, the following code is used to calculate the frequency table of the values stored in the `highway` column of ITS test data: 

```{r}
oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds", 
  query = "SELECT DISTINCT highway FROM \"lines\"", 
  force_vectortranslate = TRUE # Clean the spatial query applied before
)
```

The same `query` argument can be used to read-in only certain features, like all residential highways: 

```{r}
oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds",
  quiet = FALSE, 
  query = "SELECT * FROM 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('residential')"
)
```

This is faster and less memory intensive than reading-in the whole dataset and filtering with R.
Computational efficiency is an important topic if you are working with large OSM datasets.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  portugal1 = oe_get(
    "Portugal", 
    quiet = FALSE, 
    force_download = TRUE, 
    force_vectortranslate = TRUE, 
    query = "SELECT * from 'lines' WHERE highway IN ('primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary')"
  )
})
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   71.17   39.57  135.22 

system.time({
  portugal2 = oe_get(
    "Portugal", 
    quiet = FALSE, 
    force_download = TRUE, 
    force_vectortranslate = TRUE, 
  )
  
  portugal2 = portugal2 %>% 
    dplyr::filter(highway %in% c('primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary'))
})
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>  116.05   44.28  190.00 
```

Last but not least, we can use the function `hstore_get_value` to extract one of the tags saved in the `other_tags` column without using `ogr2ogr` and rerunning the `oe_vectortranslate()` function:: 

```{r}
# No extra tag
colnames(oe_get("ITS Leeds"))

# One extra tag
oe_get_keys(oe_get("ITS Leeds", provider = "test", download_only = TRUE))
colnames(oe_get(
  "ITS Leeds", 
  provider = "test", 
  query = "SELECT *, hstore_get_value(other_tags, 'bicycle') AS bicycle FROM lines"
))
```

# Other providers

The package supports downloading, reading and extracting OpenStreetMap data from various providers.
A list of providers can be found at [wiki.openstreetmap.org](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Processed_data_providers).
The first provider supported was [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/).
The second was [bbbike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/).
The package can be extended to support additional providers, as seen in the following [commit](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/osmextract/commit/dbf131667a80e5a6837a6c8eb3b967075e1aba16) that adds a working provider.

For information on adding new providers to the package, see the [providers vignette](https://itsleeds.github.io/osmextract/articles/providers.html).

# More on OpenStreetMap

There is a world of knowledge, convention and wisdom contained in OSM data that we hope this package helps you discover and use this knowledge for public benefit.
To learn more about the structure of OSM data and the various tagging systems and conventions, the [Elements page on the OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements) is an ideal place to start.
You will find much more excellent content on the OSM wiki pages.

# Contributing to OSM

The final thing to say in this introductory vignette is that as a citizen-led project like Wikipedia, OSM relies on a participatory culture, where people not only consume but contribute data, to survive.
On that note, we urge anyone reading this to at least sign-up to get an OSM account at [osm.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

We highly recommend contributing to the world's geographic commons.
The step from being a user to being a contributor to OSM data is a small one and can be highly rewarding.
If you find any issues with OSM data, people in the OpenStreetMap will be very happy for you to correct the data.
Once logged-in, you can contribute by using editors such as the excellent ID editor, which you can get to by zooming into anywhere you want at [www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and clicking "Edit".
